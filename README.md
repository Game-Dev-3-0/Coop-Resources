# Welcome to Game Dev 3.0!

We are hoping to be a small part in changing how games are made. We dream of a world filled with worker's cooperatives and to that end we have begun a collection of resources for others to benefit from as well.  
Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/Game-Dev-3-0/Coop-Resources/wiki) for more information.
